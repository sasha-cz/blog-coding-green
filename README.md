# üå≥ Blog: _Coding Green_ üå≥

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a simple blog using Django, understand frontend development, and implement backend components such as API endpoints with the Django REST Framework.

## Key Learnings

### Version Control Best Practices:

I realized the importance of organizing project stages into different branches and commits. This not only facilitates collaboration but also allows for a clear retrospective analysis of the development process.

### Security Awareness:

I became more mindful of handling credentials within the Git flow, emphasizing the importance of secure practices.

## Future Steps
The project is not static. I have plans to further improve it:

### Unit Testing:

Adding comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability of the codebase.

### Deployment with Docker:

Preparing the project for deployment using Docker for seamless and scalable distribution.


## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è 

If you want to run the project on your local machine you'll need to follow the setup instructions below. 

### Prerequisites:

- [Python version 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- Virtual environment tool `virtualenv`.

  üîó If you don't have already, make sure to [install virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html).

- Database: PostgreSQL
  
  üîó If you don't have already, make sure to [install PostgreSQL version 15.4](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

  With this installation the Postgres GUI pgAdmin will be installed as well, unless you uncheck the box for pgAdmin during the installation process.
  
  üîó If you did so, you'll need to [install pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) separately.
 
  The connector (database adapter) to connect your Django project with the database is already included in the requirements.txt file (see Step 3).
  

### 1. Clone the Repository
  Use the following command:
   
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sasha-cz/blog-coding-green.git
```
  
  Navigate to the project's root directory:

  `cd 'personal_website - Kopie'`

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
   
 First you will need to create a virtual environment for the project on your local machine.
 
 üîó Note: You can find the Python virtualenv docs here: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html
 

 Virtual Environment - Open a terminal and use the following command to create a virtual environment.
 
  `virtualenv env_name`

 This will create a folder in your current directory.
 
 Activate the virtual environment.

  On macOS/Linux (bash):

  `source env_name/bin/activate`
  
  On windows (bash):

`.\env_name\Scripts\activate`

You will know your virtual environment is active when your terminal displays the following:

`(virtualenv) path\to\project\personal_website - Kopie`

### 3. Installation of Dependencies:
   
  You just need to install the packages from the requirements.txt.
  To do this run in your activated environment:

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4. Database Setup:

  Run migrations to set up the database:

   `python manage.py makemigrations`

   `python manage.py migrate`


### 5. Run the Development Server

  To start the development server use the following command:

   `python manage.py runserver`

### 6. View the Website in your Browser

  Open your browser and navigate to the Homepage of the blog, located at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/`
